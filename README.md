# CryptoClustering

Overview
This project explores clustering cryptocurrency market data using K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies together. The goal is to gain insights into the market's behavior and simplify analysis through dimensionality reduction. The code implements the clustering algorithms, visualizes the results, and contrasts clustering outcomes with and without PCA.

Code Structure
crypto_clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the step-by-step analysis and clustering code.
Resources/: Directory containing the dataset crypto_market_data.csv.
Results
Clustering analysis is performed on the original dataset.
Elbow curves help determine the optimal number of clusters.
PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction and improved visualization.
Elbow curves contrast clustering outcomes between the original and PCA-transformed data.
Scatter plots visualize the clustered cryptocurrencies for comparison.
Conclusion
By leveraging K-Means and PCA, this project identifies valuable insights in cryptocurrency market data, enabling a better understanding of market behavior. The contrasting analyses help evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering results.
